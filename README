With this program you can interactively investigate some polyhedra. I use this
program myself and I am willing to share it with other who are interested. I use
Ubuntu, as a consequence some problems might exist with windows.

Requirements:
-------------
You will need:
1. Python 2.x:  http://www.python.org
2. Wxpython: http://www.wxpython.org
3. pyOpenGL: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/

E.g. for Ubuntu or other Debian based Linux dist:
----------------
1. sudo apt-get install python
2. sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk<x.x>
    Find out which version by 
    apt-cache search python-wxgtk
    e.g.
    sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8
3. sudo apt-get install python-opengl

E.g. for Arch Linux:
----------------
1. sudo pacman -S python2
    Make sure /usr/bin/python is linked to /usr/bin/python2
    Make sure /usr/bin/python-config is linked to /usr/bin/python2-config
    Make sure /usr/bin/pydoc is linked to /usr/bin/pydoc2
2. sudo pacman -S wxpython
3. sudo pacman -S python2-opengl

Run:
----
cd to directory
./Orbitit.py

Segmentation Faults:
--------------------

Ig you get a segmentation fault, make sure that you have a python with debug
symbols. Then in the Orbitit directory exevute the following:
$ gdb python
...
(gdb) run
...
>>> import Orbitit

Then do your stuff to recreate the segmentation fault.
E.g. you might see the following:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x024303aa in ?? () from /usr/lib/nvidia-xxx/libGLcore.so.1

Then the crash was caused your nvidia-xxx driver.
