move export to PS stuff from 'working branch' to master and check where the
MW115 error comes from

2012-02-26
Move rest of general fixes from 'working branch' to master branch

Orbitit:
	2012-02-11
	export to off: specify precision, since Ulrich had a problem with
	Stella, which might be precision related.

	2012-02-12
	Add view settings: list all faces by length and choose colour
	These nrs can be used for exporting to PS: only export...

	2012-02-14
	Enable start Orbitit with a specified scene
	Open any python scene through File -> Open menu (call it plug-in?)

	2012-02-14
	Open / Import python files

	2012-02-14
	handle pentagrams: in export to PS, it should be one edge. Perhaps you
	should have them as pentagrams with 5 edges and handle the 3D stuff...
	That will help for the new scene as well.

Geom3D:
	2012-02-11
	export to PS: print faces that ly in the same plane on top of each other

	2012-02-11
	export to PS: show lines with problem with different colour


Scene_Orbit:
	2012-02-26:
		TODO cannot import compound shapes: if fixed, update compound
		repr, see patch:
		ec3a24a, Geom3D: add reprs for simple and compound shape
		TODO set angle by copy paste
		TODO orbit test: apply, rotate, then colour: no rotation
		TODO cannot handle compound of isometric shapes:
			in CompoundShape.setShapes:
				shape.gl.alwaysSetVertices = True

	when you choose the last colour alternative and switch colours and this
	one has less options, you get a list index out of range. I.e. you need
	to reset the colour alternative.

	2012-02-26
	Create a rotate arount axis widget, which can be used by the orbit scene
