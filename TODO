	make it possible to configure by command line which fold to search

	2012-03-25 - 02
	Also unpdate the command line to configure the edge lengths by std
	option, like the -a and -A

	2012-03-25 - 03
	I noticed that a doublet that was thrown some time in
		data/Data_FldHeptA4/frh-roots-0_0_1_1_0_1_1-fld_w.0-strip_1_loose-opp_shell_1_loose.py
	was the exact same solution. Could it be that when comparing
	first you see difference then you write with a certain precision
	and then they are equal?

	When frh-roots-1_1_1_1-fld_parallel.0-alt_rot_strip_1_loose.py
	it doesn't set the right triangle fill

	Why are these generated? What are these anyway?

	make sure to handle precision increase, ie read old values and apply new
	iteration on these until required precision. Perhaps you want to have a
	certain precision to go to, but another for values being equal...

PRIO
2012-09-19 - Heptagons Scene: there is a shell fill that is the opposite of the
             current one. I.e. the origin is opposite. Note that for a W-fold
	     and a trapezium fold this doesn't make much sense...

2012-03-08 - 2 Implement a float slider with support for set

2012-03-01 - 2 fix empty OFF file read

2012-03-03 - 16:28 simplified print to PS from orbit scene.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2012-03-08 - 2
Implement a float slider with support for set. Use Scene_Orbit as an example.

2012-03-01 - 2
fix empty OFF file read: make error message more readable than now.

test:
	2012-03-05 0:45
	Add some performance test, with a limit.

	2012-03-05 0:46
	Split test, so you can run them separately?

Orbitit - Geom3D:
	2012-03-03 - 16:28
	THe orbit scene creates compounds of symmetric shapes now, so output to
	PS checks all the faces again, while only the faces from the base shape
	are needed. Fix this. First and mainly for compounds of 1 shape.

Orbitit:
	2012-02-12
	Add view settings: list all faces by length and choose colour
	These nrs can be used for exporting to PS: only export...

	2012-02-14 - 2
	Enable start Orbitit with a specified scene
	Open any python scene through File -> Open menu (call it plug-in?)

	2012-02-14 - 3
	Open / Import python files

	2012-03-01 - 4
	add command line parameters for auto test.

	2012-02-14 - 4
	handle pentagrams: in export to PS, it should be one edge. Perhaps you
	should have them as pentagrams with 5 edges and handle the 3D stuff...
	That will help for the new scene as well.

equilateral heptagons:

Scenes:
	2012-02-27
	Move the fancy logging from '1c56863 orbit: add fancy logging' to the
	general scenes file (from Scene_Orbit.py).

Geom3D:
	2012-03-03 - 16:33
	The cleaned up shape could destroy the colours if faces are deleted.

	2012-02-11
	export to PS: print faces that ly in the same plane on top of each other

	2012-02-11
	export to PS: show lines with problem with different colour

	2012-03-01 - 3
	extra info in toOffStr file: angles aren't merged that should have after
	rounding.

Scene_Orbit:
	2012-05-06:
		TODO: add GUI support for special mu_s:
			- add special mu (button)
			- reset special angles (button)
		ERROR: assertion error for data/cubeCompounds/c_3B_D3xI_C2xI.py
			even while setting up Dn (n=3) with std settings and
			stabliliser E. It seems there is a wrong subgroup.
	2012-02-26:
		TODO set angle by copy paste
		TODO fix the following orbit test: apply, rotate, then colour:
			no rotation
		TODO cannot handle compound of isometric shapes:
			in CompoundShape.setShapes:
				shape.gl.alwaysSetVertices = True

	2012-02-26
	Create a rotate arount axis widget, which can be used by the orbit scene
